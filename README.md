## How to use

First copy the repo into your disk.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vicklin/shell-stock.git
```

then

```bash
$ cd shell-stock/bin

$ chmod +x start.sh

```

of course you can make an alias in your .bashrc or make a link so that you can call this application anywhere you like.
